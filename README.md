# EvolutionaryAlgorithms
Solving cutting stock problem with E.A
solution.py contains the solution based on evolutionary algorithm PSO,DEGL. Also, they are  compared with other algorithms.
DEGL contains the Class for differential evolution algorithm same applies to DynNeighborPSO for the PSO algorithm.
utils contains classes and functions useful for printing the stock and orders
